# Kotlin Hello World

I want to get familiar with developing in the JVM environment in order to work with Kafka. To start, I followed the [Gradle
docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample_building_kotlin_applications.html) on building a sample Kotlin App.

Use the following commands to build and then run this app:
```shell
make build
make run
```
